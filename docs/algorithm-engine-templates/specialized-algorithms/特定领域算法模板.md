2. README Analysis:

The README describes the project as a Windows WPF app by ColrVision Inc for advanced color management and photoelectric solutions.

Key points:

- "支持操作系统：Win10,Win11" - Supports Windows 10 and 11.

- "服务" - Supports services like camera, calibration, algorithm, spectrometer, PG, sensor, source meter, motor, file server.
- "模板" - Templates can be created, edited, imported/exported, saved in database. Templates require DB connection.
- "分类" - Template categories: flow, focus points, compliance check, calibration, algorithms (extract focus points, MTF, FOV, ghosting, distortion, SFR).
- "任务计划程序" - Task scheduler supports immediate, delayed, single, multiple, repeated execution with Cron.
- "更新" - Supports manual, config-based, scheduled updates.
- "插件" - Users can implement plugins by IPlugin interface, loaded on startup.
- "项目" - Projects and window functionality are decoupled, users can open projects or use plugins in menu mode.
- "工程" - Supports project files (.cvproject, .cvsolution), image preview, post-processing, export.
- "语言" - Uses C# native resource files for localization, not runtime switchable but can be done with style switching.
- "热键" - Supports global and window mode hotkeys, configurable.

This README provides a high-level overview of system capabilities, modularity, and user features. It confirms the modular architecture and emphasis on templates for domain-specific algorithm applications. It also highlights the dependency on database connectivity for templates and the extensibility via plugins.

3. Core Data Structures and Algorithms Analysis:

From the catalogue and README, the core data structures likely include:

- Template-related classes (TemplateModel, TemplateSetting, ParamModBase, TemplateMatch, etc.) for defining algorithm templates.
- Algorithm classes for AR/VR distortion, ghosting, MTF, FOV, SFR, LED strip detection, image cropping, ROI, POI, compliance, focus points, JND, and others.
- Flow and service classes for managing process flows and device services.
- Data Access Objects (DAO) for database interaction (e.g., ModMasterDao, ModDetailDao).
- MQTT and MySQL communication classes.
- Image and video processing classes (OpenCV helpers, CVImageChannelLib).
- UI MVVM classes (ViewModelBase, RelayCommand).
- Various parameter and result classes for algorithms.

Algorithms:
- Image processing and analysis algorithms for AR/VR testing, LED detection, color science.

6. Code Architecture Mapping:

Plan to create:

1. Overall system architecture diagram showing main modules (Engine, UI, Projects, Plugins, Core).
2. Dependency graph for template engine components.
3. Class diagrams for template classes and algorithm classes.
4. Data flow diagram for template processing from input image to output results.
5. Sequence diagram for template creation, editing, execution, and result display.
6. State diagrams for template lifecycle.
7. Control flow diagrams for key algorithms like distortion correction, ghost detection.

These visualizations will clarify component interactions, data processing, and user workflows.

7. Deep Dependency Analysis:

- Analyze coupling between Engine templates and UI.
- Dependency of templates on database and MQTT services.
- Plugin interface dependencies.
- Inter-template dependencies (e.g., compliance depends on focus points).
- External dependencies on OpenCV, CUDA.
- Identify potential circular dependencies or high coupling.
- Suggest modularization or interface abstractions if needed.

8. Documentation Strategy Development:

- Structure document to start with introduction and project overview.
- Detailed explanation of project structure and main modules.
- Core components section focusing on algorithm templates and their roles.
- Architecture overview with diagrams.
- Detailed component analysis with code snippets, parameter explanations, and expected outputs.
