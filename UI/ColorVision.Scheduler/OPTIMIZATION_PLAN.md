### Identified Issues

#### 1. Code Quality Issues
- ✗ **Unawaited async calls**: CreateTask.xaml.cs lines 55, 59; TaskViewerWindow.xaml.cs line 153
- ✗ **Nullable reference warnings**: TaskViewerWindow.xaml.cs lines 149, 153
- ✗ **Naming conflict**: ISchedulerService.Stop() conflicts with reserved keyword
- ✗ **Performance warnings**: Using Substring instead of AsSpan (CA1845)
- ✗ **Static method suggestions**: ValidateSchedulerInfo and BuildTrigger can be marked as static

#### 2. Architecture Issues
- ✗ **Singleton overuse**: Limits testability and extensibility
- ✗ **Mixed responsibilities**: Manager handles persistence, UI commands, and business logic
- ✗ **Hardcoded paths**: Configuration file path hardcoded
- ✗ **Missing DI**: High coupling between components

#### 3. Functional Defects
- ✗ **Task state sync**: RunCount not updated in JobExecutedEvent
- ✗ **Insufficient error handling**: Some exceptions only show MessageBox without logging
- ✗ **Simple recovery**: 5-second delay is too simplistic, lacks health check
- ✗ **No concurrency control**: Missing task concurrency limits
- ✗ **No priority**: Task priority not supported

#### 4. Performance Issues
- ✗ **Serialization**: TypeNameHandling.All impacts performance and security
- ✗ **UI blocking**: Some operations may block UI thread
- ✗ **Memory leak risk**: Event subscriptions not properly unsubscribed
- ✗ **Persistence**: Saves entire list on every change

#### 5. Security Issues
- ✗ **Type safety**: TypeNameHandling.All poses deserialization security risks
- ✗ **Access control**: Missing task operation permission verification
- ✗ **Input validation**: Insufficient input validation in some areas
